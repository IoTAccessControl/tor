 * \brief Circuit padding state machines
 *
 * Introduce circuit padding machines that will be used by Tor circuits, as
 * specified by proposal 302 "Hiding onion service clients using padding".
 *
 * Right now this file introduces two machines that aim to hide the client-side
 * of onion service circuits against naive classifiers like the ones from the
 * "Circuit Fingerprinting Attacks: Passive Deanonymization of Tor Hidden
 * Services" paper from USENIX. By naive classifiers we mean classifiers that
 * use basic features like "circuit construction circuits" and "incoming and
 * outgoing cell counts" and "duration of activity".
 *
 * In particular, these machines aim to be lightweight and protect against
 * these basic classifiers. They don't aim to protect against more advanced
 * attacks that use deep learning or even correlate various circuit
 * construction events together. Machines that fool such advanced classifiers
 * are also possible, but they can't be so lightweight and might require more
 * WTF-PAD features. So for now we opt for the following two machines:
 *
 * Client-side introduction circuit hiding machine:
 *
 *    This machine hides client-side introduction circuits by making their
 *    circuit construction sequence look like normal general circuits that
 *    download directory information. Furthermore, the circuits are kept open
 *    until all the padding has been sent, since intro circuits are usually
 *    very short lived and this act as a distinguisher. For more info see
 *    circpad_machine_client_hide_intro_circuits() and the sec.
 *
 * Client-side rendezvous circuit hiding machine:
 *
 *    This machine hides client-side rendezvous circuits by making their
 *    circuit construction sequence look like normal general circuits. For more
 *    details see circpad_machine_client_hide_rend_circuits() and the spec.
 *
 * TODO: These are simple machines that carefully manipulate the cells of the
 *   initial circuit setup procedure to make them look like general
 *   circuits. In the future, more states can be baked into their state machine
 *   to do more advanced obfuscation.

   * appropriately.
   *
   * In particular we want introduction circuits to blend as much as possible
   * with general circuits. Most general circuits have the following initial
   * relay cell sequence (outgoing cells marked in [brackets]):
   *
   * [EXTEND2] -> EXTENDED2 -> [EXTEND2] -> EXTENDED2 -> [BEGIN] -> CONNECTED
   *   -> [DATA] -> [DATA] -> DATA -> DATA...(inbound data cells continue)

   * [EXTEND2] -> EXTENDED2 -> [EXTEND2] -> EXTENDED2 -> [EXTEND2] -> EXTENDED2
   *   -> [INTRO1] -> INTRODUCE_ACK
   *
   * This means that up to the sixth cell (first line of each sequence above),
   * both general and intro circuits have identical cell sequences. After that
   * we want to mimic the second line sequence of
   *   -> [DATA] -> [DATA] -> DATA -> DATA...(inbound data cells continue)
   *
   * We achieve this by starting padding INTRODUCE1 has been sent. With padding
   * negotiation cells, in the common case of the second line looks like:
   *   -> [INTRO1] -> [PADDING_NEGOTIATE] -> PADDING_NEGOTIATED -> INTRO_ACK
   *
   * Then, the middle node will send between INTRO_MACHINE_MINIMUM_PADDING and
   * INTRO_MACHINE_MAXIMUM_PADDING cells, to match the "...(inbound data cells
   * continue)" portion of the trace (aka the rest of an HTTPS response body).
